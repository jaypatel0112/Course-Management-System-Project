# COURSE_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
The objective of the Project is to develop an Application which is similar to D2L. Major sections of this App would be:
1. Login / Sign-up, Events
2. Course Catalog and Enrollment Section
3. Course Detail Page
4. Student Accounts
5. Profile
6. Student Resources
7. Advisors Appointment

All of these Sections will be Accessible from a HomePage similar to Campus Connect. All the sections will be displayed as Cards to select from. The submission document for this app is located [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O24gv_99QWmvtr7fXyRh1UDozIoA5l4M_CWXlHaJSF8/edit)
