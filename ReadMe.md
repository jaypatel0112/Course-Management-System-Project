# COURSE_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
The objective of the Project is to develop an Application which is similar to D2L. Major sections of this App would be:
1. Login / Sign-up
2. Course Search and Enrollment
3. Enrolled Courses
4. Course Specific Content
5. Profile

All of these Sections will be Accessible from a HomePage similar to Campus Connect. All the sections will be dsiplayed as Cards to select from.

| # | Area                 | Decision              | Alternative             | Rationale                                                                             |

| 2 | Dependency Management| Maven                 | Gradle                  | All team members are familiar with the build tool                                     |
| 3 | ORM                  | JPA, Hibernate        | -                       | Need to implement this for Java Object -> Database Rows and vice versa                |
| 4 | Database             | H2                    | MySQL                   | Sticking to a RDBMS which meets current requirements. Might pivot to NoSql if need be |
