 * Added UI elements to display the rental button on the homepage
 * Added a new page to display rentals interface and the ability to rent equipment
 * Added service to rentals to fetch the data from the tables and display which items are available.
 * Will implement service to take out rentals and have them tracked via the rental and Equipment tables
 * The rental tables currently are tied to user account info, and are only displayed ot logged-in users
 * and keep track of the rentals they have taken out.
 * Added One for one between the Rentals repository and the Rental Service
 * Everything in the rentals package is a work in progress and is being worked on by me.
